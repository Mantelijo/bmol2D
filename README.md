# BMol2D
Schematic 2D biomolecule interactions visualizer.

## Source structure
- **src** project source code 
    - **components** react components
    - **lib**
        -  **format** interfaces and types which define atoms, biomolecules, etc.

## TODO List
- Universal data structure to accommodate data for visualizations.
- Correct double stranded DNA interactions between sister strands.
- Universal Visualization system, that can adapted for multiple types of visualizations.
  - Visualization types:
    - Double Stranded DNA - protein interactions
    - Single Stranded RNA - protein interactions
    - Double stranded RNA (TBD)
